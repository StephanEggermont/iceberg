	"TODO (issue #81): Cloning with https doesn't require credentials. This is done because of a bug between libgit2/libssh2 which keeps ssh authentication from working. Yet, our current tests do not use this behavior so it is not clear that it works. Moreover, I tested that ssh does not work with clone, but this implementation suggests that it might work for other commands (?). "
